# Algorithms_Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of two key algorithms in C#:
- **Heap-Sort Algorithm**: A sorting algorithm using the heap data structure.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: An algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.

## **Project Description**
This project was developed as part of the **Analysis and Design of Algorithms** course. It demonstrates:
1. The ability to analyze, design, and implement algorithms efficiently.
2. Understanding and applying **Heap-Sort** for sorting data.
3. Using **Kruskal's Algorithm** to solve graph problems like finding the MST.
